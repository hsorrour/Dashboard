This project is an interactive dashboard built using a road accident dataset. To achieve the final result, I began with data cleaning, ensuring that the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.
I then created pivot tables to answer key questions, such as:
 - What was the total number of casualties from 2021 to 2023?
 - How does weather impact the frequency of accidents?
 - What is the influence of road type on accident rates?
 and other questions that lead up to this interactive dashboard, which allows users to explore and analyze the data dynamically.
 Additionally, the dashboard includes filters, such as a timeline for specific years and a selection between urban and rural areas.
As these filters are adjusted, the dashboardâ€™s numbers and graphs update accordingly, providing an interactive and detailed exploration of the dataset.
